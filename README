Nibbler project: A simple snake like game written in C++ using dynamically linked libraries and demostrating the use of library switching at runtime.

The program is docker containerised so that it can be run in a platform agnostic way, as long as Docker is installed.

To build:

/**** if you are on mac to setup docker-machine run (must be preinstalled together with virtualbox) *****/

$>docker-machine create --driver virtualbox nibbler-machine
$>eval "$(docker-machine env nibbler-machine)"

/**** continue below (might require sudo priviledges ****/

$> chmod 755 run.sh
$> ./run.sh

You are now inside the container - to make and run:
$>make
$>./nibbler (size_x) (size_y)


Usage:

Arrow keys are used to control the snake, numbers 1, 2 and 3 are used to switch between libraries, which have been implemented using different colors to indicate that libraries have been switched.
